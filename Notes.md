# Notes from BYU CS 260 Class: Web Programming

## Assignment 1: Git and Github:

-Create a repo first in Github and then clone to local machine using 'git clone'
-Commit **often** and commit one change at a time
-Avoid committing large files
-Use 'git checkout' to peruse previous commits, and configure one to be the HEAD if you'd like to revert to that version
-Fix merge conflicts by pulling from GitHub (merge) and then clarify conflicting lines in VSCode
