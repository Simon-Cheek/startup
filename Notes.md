# Notes from BYU CS 260 Class: Web Programming

## Assignment 1: Git and GitHub:

- Create a repo first in GitHub and then clone to local machine using 'git clone'
- Commit *often* and commit one change at a time
- Avoid committing large files
- Use 'git checkout' to peruse previous commits, and configure one to be the HEAD if you'd like to revert to that version
- Fix merge conflicts by pulling from GitHub (merge) and then clarify conflicting lines in VSCode

## Assignment 2: Launching an AWS Instance:

- EC2 Instance creates a web server that can be accessed via SSH command
- Key Value Pair (security) is needed to access the server (which is Linux)
- Elastic IP Address has been associated and is: 54.173.84.241
- Tech Stack consists of Node.JS, MongoDB, and Caddy2
- Domain Name is gollab.click ! and had DNS records connected to gollab.click as well as \*.gollab.click to redirect subdomains
