# Notes from BYU CS 260 Class: Web Programming

## Assignment 1: Git and GitHub:

- Create a repo first in GitHub and then clone to local machine using 'git clone'
- Commit *often* and commit one change at a time
- Avoid committing large files
- Use 'git checkout' to peruse previous commits, and configure one to be the HEAD if you'd like to revert to that version
- Fix merge conflicts by pulling from GitHub (merge) and then clarify conflicting lines in VSCode
